Student project:

Replicate a legislative drafting process in a GitHub repository.

Could be done at federal, state, or local government level.  Need to identify records of a legislative drafting process, then create a git repo on GitHub that acts as though the full drafting, discussion, amendment process was implemented using GitHub features.

hat tip to Eva Maxfield Brown at Uwashington for this great idea!
